Sims4,Unpopular Opinion: I hate hot townie makeovers. I want them all to look like they are two steps away from disaster.,"Yes, that jawline could cut glass and those eyes glisten like stars scattered over the gently shimmering water of a cool lagoon...

Straight to jail. 

I want my townies pear-shaped, chinless and wearing ski boots and a bridal veil to the library. I want Judith Ward to show up at an awards ceremony married to a hot dog with purple hair and no teeth. I want Vlad and his seven cats to walk past my house in speedos and a wrestling mask. 

Say no to yassification. Say YES to free spirits.

(I mean, obviously play how you want to play. For me, a lot of the fun is the chaos that randomly generates.)",0.98,5719,0,5719

Sims4,Not sure if this is an Unpopular Opinion or not- But I wish the sims four wasn't so damn tech based!,"I get it, it's meant to be a modern game. I just wish I could play a more ""historically ambiguous"" save without everyone whipping out their phones  :'/ or having to use the computer to do everything, or having to use the phone to even get things like a job- Ugh! I wish there were still newspapers or at least some kind of alternative to this, besides off the grid, which is too much of a pain to bother with. Sometimes It really breaks the immersion in a save!",0.98,3939,0,3939
Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3537,0,3537
Sims4,Unpopular Opinion: we don't need cars.,I was watching pixalade's recent video about the new pack and he was talking about how people were noticing that the way the sidewalks are designed and how it indicated cars and how that theory was shot down by someone on the Sims team and how upsetting it was etc. I couldn't help but think of how much of a non-issue it is. Like...cars would still be rabbit holes with the current mechanics of the game. I don't think it's that big a deal we don't have them. I do like that they're making it easier to build driveways and stuff because of aesthetics but am I the only one who doesn't see the point or think it's a big deal? I'd much rather the Sims team fix current issues and put out worthwhile game play then add a rabbit hole that isn't really important for game play.,0.96,3167,0,3167

Sims4,Nothing ever goes wrong and I hate it,"I've seen many posts of people talking about how a random event ruined their sims' lives or their plans for the future, but for me the worst that had ever happened was Vlad burning up on one of my Sim's wedding (he was the bride's adoptive father).

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Do any of you have the same problem? How do you fix it?",0.99,2462,0,2462
Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Edit: I logged back on a day later and i have over 150 notifications, what have I done lmfao XD",0.99,2458,0,2458
Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2354,0,2354

Sims4,Possible unpopular opinion about the new Game Pack,"Like I know this is EA and The Sims, but shouldnt all these (ok at least a few) wedding features be added to the base game instead? Like I get the appeal of a new world and items, etc, but its something that just seems like everyone should be able to enjoy.
Like ok I guess I will just keep getting my sims married in the yard with people doing push ups in the background with disaster townies just because I wont pay yet another additional fee? Seems ridiculous imo.
Anyway maybe this was just me ranting haha",0.95,2215,0,2215
Sims4,"Unpopular opinion but you actually don't have to buy every sims pack/ kit and just because you don't like it , it doesn't make it bad","Do I like kits? No. But just because im not interested in it does not mean they're terrible or people who do like them should be shamed . EA keeps coming out with more kits because people are obviously buying them and there is obviously some type of demand for them . Get over it . Some people are console players and do not have the luxury of downloading CC. If you don't like it , literally just do not buy it . Tired of people acting like they're obligated and have a gun to their head to buy packs / kits they don't like . If it doesn't interest you or you think 5 ( the cost of a drink ) is too expensive then here's an idea, don't buy it :)",0.87,2118,0,2118
Sims4,I HATE when my Sims have specific interests,"I know you guys know what I mean? The most common one is when they are obsessed with the family computer, right? There are many others I hate and want to rant about!

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I cant find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and dont even drink them! Sometimes I dont even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and theres about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I dont even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - its fine in the summer but in the winter? When its snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die. 

Thats all for now. Thanks for letting me rant.",0.99,2089,0,2089
Sims4,Unpopular opinion: I regret getting the seasons pack,"I waited years to get the seasons pack because it was just out of my price range, so when I got a gift card I was SO excited to finally get seasons. I was disappointed. Sure, building snowmen and playing in the rain are cute actions, but so much of the pack is just annoying. Like, I feel like plants are never in season long enough to make the most of them, and I feel like theres a holiday every other day (yes, Ive edited the calendar to have fewer holidays but still). 

Its probably just my personal play style, but I feel like the only thing I really like about seasons is that theres weather.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Sims4,I hate the wall decorations,"I hate that there is a lot of wall decor but none of if really goes together. Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3539,0,3539

Like...cars would still be rabbit holes with the current mechanics of the game. I don't think it's that big a deal we don't have them. I do like that they're making it easier to build driveways and stuff because of aesthetics but am I the only one who doesn't see the point or think it's a big deal?

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2353,0,2353

Sims4,I HATE when my Sims have specific interests,"I know you guys know what I mean? The most common one is when they are obsessed with the family computer, right? There are many others I hate and want to rant about!

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3536,0,3536

Like...cars would still be rabbit holes with the current mechanics of the game. I don't think it's that big a deal we don't have them. I do like that they're making it easier to build driveways and stuff because of aesthetics but am I the only one who doesn't see the point or think it's a big deal?

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2355,0,2355

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3534,0,3534

Like...cars would still be rabbit holes with the current mechanics of the game. I don't think it's that big a deal we don't have them. I do like that they're making it easier to build driveways and stuff because of aesthetics but am I the only one who doesn't see the point or think it's a big deal?

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2357,0,2357

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3532,0,3532

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2355,0,2355

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2354,0,2354

Sims4,I HATE when my Sims have specific interests,"I know you guys know what I mean? The most common one is when they are obsessed with the family computer, right? There are many others I hate and want to rant about!

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3532,0,3532

At this point I'm not sure if the game is too safe or if it's my micromanaging that's making things go too smooth. I would love to have more risky and unpredictable gameplay, but everything just goes according to plan everytime, making things kinda boring.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2358,0,2358

Sims4,I HATE when my Sims have specific interests,"I know you guys know what I mean? The most common one is when they are obsessed with the family computer, right? There are many others I hate and want to rant about!

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Sims4,Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2357,0,2357

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3538,0,3538

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

(Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean?

It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world.

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3536,0,3536

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system.

The stereo - seriously, half the time when I can‚Äôt find them, they are dancing in front of that damn radio. And the toddlers dance in front of it and get mad at dancing! I have to turn it off multiple times just to get them to do their tasks.

The bar - it kills me when they go to the bar in an Inspired mood. They not only go and make a drink, they make multiple drinks! About half a dozen and don‚Äôt even drink them! Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Sims4,Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

That is messed up.  Still going to do it, don't get me wrong, but man.",1.0,3532,0,3532

Sims4,Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2360,0,2360

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

Like, I feel like plants are never in season long enough to make the most of them, and I feel like there‚Äôs a holiday every other day (yes, I‚Äôve edited the calendar to have fewer holidays but still). 

It‚Äôs probably just my personal play style, but I feel like the only thing I really like about seasons is that there‚Äôs weather.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

I decided I wanted a single mother household. Havannah fell in love with her high school sweetheart, however, his family never approved of their relationship so when she becomes pregnant while going through nursing school. He books it out on her and their daughter's life. Now, Havannah works herself ragged trying to keep the lights on while also giving her daughter the attention and time she deserves.

Here they are on her day off dancing together. I literally LOVE them. I'm also exploring the interactive doctor career which I've never done before so that's also a fun experience for me. But I adore this little family. ",1.0,9,0,9

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

I decided I wanted a single mother household. Havannah fell in love with her high school sweetheart, however, his family never approved of their relationship so when she becomes pregnant while going through nursing school. He books it out on her and their daughter's life. Now, Havannah works herself ragged trying to keep the lights on while also giving her daughter the attention and time she deserves.

Here they are on her day off dancing together. I literally LOVE them. I'm also exploring the interactive doctor career which I've never done before so that's also a fun experience for me. But I adore this little family. ",0.92,9,0,9

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

I haven't played Citudad Emoranda yet but its giving me the same vibes. I also dislike San Sequoia for similar reasons but I haven't really played it.",0.98,1676,0,1676

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

I haven't played Citudad Emoranda yet but its giving me the same vibes. I also dislike San Sequoia for similar reasons but I haven't really played it.",0.98,1675,0,1675

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

I haven't played Citudad Emoranda yet but its giving me the same vibes. I also dislike San Sequoia for similar reasons but I haven't really played it.",0.98,1675,0,1675

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Sims4,I hate the wall decorations,"I hate that there is a lot of wall decor but none of if really goes together. Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Sims4,I hate the wall decorations,"I hate that there is a lot of wall decor but none of if really goes together. Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Sims4,I hate the wall decorations,"I hate that there is a lot of wall decor but none of if really goes together. Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Sims4,I hate the wall decorations,"I hate that there is a lot of wall decor but none of if really goes together. Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

I haven't played Citudad Emoranda yet but its giving me the same vibes. I also dislike San Sequoia for similar reasons but I haven't really played it.",0.98,1677,0,1677

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.

Everytime I redecorate a house I always dread decorating the walls cause there are very few things that will look like it belongs or fits the aesthetic I'm going for. Like the mage wall hunk for example, I'm never gonna use that in a build because it doesn't look right to have a hunk of wood sticking out the wall. The only way I can see that being used and look half way decent is if you use it on the outside of a house to try and make it look like a log cabin. 

I want more wall decor that isn't light up signs, menus, business signs, plaques or stickers. I want wall decor like mega wall hanging, festive felt flowers, pink pig copper mold, copper cow mold, wish in a dish, sunny days wall decor, Polly wants a plate tree, and goldora dove decor.

Sims4,I hate Tomarang,"I grew up in Thailand so I was excited to play the world. Conversely, I now live in a small English village much like Henford, and I adore that world. The environment and atmosphere feels exactly right. Same with Britechester. But Tomarang has no atmosphere at all!! It functions like a ghost town and it irritates me how 3 of the 9 (!!) lots are empty. I get having a few empty lots for builders but it makes the world feel so claustrophobic when there's literally not much else. My sim living there was dirt broke and grinding and I really felt her misery honestly so at least there's that.

I think if they wanted to do a Thailand inspired pack they should've done 3 neighbourhoods - an island one like Koh Samui (which could've had festivals), a historic city one like Pattana, and a bustling modern city like Bangkok. There's so much cool nightlife in Bangkok, and especially for an APARTMENTS pack, it feels like they missed a trick.

Emptiness aside, the world just feels so drab. The paved grey streets and unplayable boats. There's none of the promised lore and whimsy. Am I missing something? I just hate it, especially for the lost potential. There's not even enough lots for a non builder like me to download other people's builds.
